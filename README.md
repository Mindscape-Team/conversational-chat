I'm here to listen and talk with you. You can also do grounding exercises or calming techniques with me if you prefer.

## Integration Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. Always store the `session_id` returned from `/start_session`
2. Use the same `user_id` throughout a conversation
3. Include appropriate error handling for API responses
4. Monitor the health endpoint for system status

### Error Handling
The API returns standard HTTP status codes:
- 200: Success
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Not Found
- 500: Internal Server Error

Error responses include a detail message:
```json
{
    "detail": "Error message here"
}
```
